Description: 	 	- Synthesisor project consisting of 6 oscillators, each with multiple wave forms (Sine, Saw, Triangle etc)
			- Written in C#, WPF using MVVM architecture with automated Test Environment.
			- A detailed diagram of full architecture can be found in the file "SimpleSynthArchitecture.png"
				 
Would recommend the combo of sine, saw & triangle waves, and messing with the octave shifter for some mad sounds.
Enjoy!
